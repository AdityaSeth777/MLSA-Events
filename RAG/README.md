# Event Demo: Intelligent Query Systems with RAG and LLMs in Python

Welcome to the repository for the **"Building Intelligent Query Systems with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLMs in Python, Powered by Ollama"** event. This repository contains two examples to help you get started with RAG-powered applications.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure

### 1. **Python-Simple**  
This folder contains a **basic example** designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLMs in Python.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Lightweight and minimal dependencies.  
  - Focuses on core concepts of RAG with simple Python scripts.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for beginners or those new to the concept.

### 2. **azure-search-openai-demo**  
This folder contains the **live example** showcased during the event. It demonstrates how to build a robust, production-grade query system using Azure Cognitive Search and OpenAI.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Integrates with Azure Cognitive Search for scalable data retrieval.  
  - Uses OpenAI models for intelligent query processing.  
  - Includes detailed steps for deployment and configuration.  
- **Use Case**: Designed for real-world, enterprise-level applications.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/MLSA-Events.git
   cd RAG
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of your choice:
   - For the basic example:  
     ```bash
     cd Python-Simple
     ```
   - For the advanced demo:  
     ```bash
     cd azure-search-openai-demo
     ```

3. Follow the instructions in each folder's `README.md` file to set up and run the example.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes  
- The **Python-Simple** folder is perfect for experimenting with the basics of RAG and LLMs in Python.  
- The **azure-search-openai-demo** folder is a more complex and realistic example, demonstrating advanced capabilities with Azure and OpenAI integration.

Feel free to explore both examples and adapt them to your use cases!
